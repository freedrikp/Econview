=== TODO ===
*Search accounts and stored transactions.
*Extract class-framework for JTables that interact with the database.
*Support standing transactions (not clear on how to implement this).
*Support transfer transactions.
*Make transactiondialog work better when selecting account, dynamic update on typing.
*Instead of showing all details in transactionDialog, only show name of stored transactions with button to edit.
*Instead of Hidden, use categories.
*Create client/server database. (Server authenticates when opening a socket and closes it if faulty credentials.|Start with standard sockets then switch to ssl|Extract series of interfaces so that the client database implements both Security and Database.)
*Remove all GUI parts from database (Progressmonitor)
*Improve Configuration parsing with allowed values, example, DIAGRAMS_STYLE[SPLIT,TAB].
*Refactor database classes and remove duplicated code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Set better tick count, start of weeks/months. (dont know if this makes sense)
